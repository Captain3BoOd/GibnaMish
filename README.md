# GibnaMish Chess Engine

Welcome to GibnaMish, a chess engine project developed in C++. As my first project in C++, I've dedicated substantial time and effort to its development. My goal is to make GibnaMish one of the most powerful and efficient chess engines in the world.

## Updates

In recent developments, I've restructured the entire engine and added several new features to enhance its capabilities.

## Inspirations

I have learned a great deal from the following chess engines and would like to express my gratitude to their authors:

- [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) – [GPL-3.0 License](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/Copying.txt)
- [Smallbrain](https://github.com/Disservin/Smallbrain) – [GPL-3.0 License](https://github.com/Disservin/Smallbrain/blob/main/LICENSE)

## Tools and Libraries

Certain parts of the code are adapted from other projects. I extend my thanks to their authors and respect the licenses of these projects:

- [chess-library](https://github.com/Disservin/chess-library) – [MIT License](https://github.com/Disservin/chess-library/blob/master/LICENSE)
- [Incbin](https://github.com/graphitemaster/incbin) – [UNLICENSE](https://github.com/graphitemaster/incbin/blob/main/UNLICENSE)

## Special Thanks

A special thanks to [Disservin](https://github.com/Disservin) for his projects, which have greatly contributed to my work on GibnaMish. In particular, his Smallbrain engine has been a valuable resource. I also want to acknowledge Bluefever Software's [Chess Engine In C](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ1QII7yudbc-Ky058TEaOstZHVbT-2hg&si=K8UHgAkpbcJxaL9s) YouTube playlist, from which I have gained significant insights.
